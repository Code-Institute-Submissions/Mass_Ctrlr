## Overview

My MS1 project in my Code Institute course – there were many different project ideas and suggestions, one being a website for a band (real or fictional). I decided to base my band website on a real band, Mass Ctrlr, a rock band based in Manchester. The members of Mass Ctrlr are close friends of mine and I wanted to base my website on them so that I had a personal connection to the project but also to be able to let them potentially use a version of the website in the future, if they so wished.  

The main goal of the website is to promote the band and their activities, expand their fan base, to create a central hub for all information and pages relating to the band and also to increase opportunities for the band such as bookings for events and gigs.  

The Mass Ctrlr website was created as a Milestone Project 1 as a part of **Diploma in Full Stack Software Development** with **Code Institute**. The project is developed primarily using HTML and CSS programs, with a small amount of JavaScript implemented for additional functionality.  

## UX (User Experience)

The user types for this website would be fans (old and new), key people within the music industry and the band themselves.  

### Visitor Stories *(Fans, old and new, and Music Industry people)*

1.	As a site visitor, I would like to learn more about the band, their members, musical style and their history.
2.	As a site visitor, I would like to easily navigate through the site and find what I'm looking for with an ease.
3.	As a site visitor, I would like to be able to easily find links to the band’s music and social media pages so I can follow the band on there as well.
4.	As a site visitor, I would like to be able to contact the band to book them for gigs or find out more information.
5.	As a site visitor, I would like that the website is responsive on all screen sizes.

### Business Stories *(The Band)*

1.	As a business owner, I would like to have the website that is elegant, simple and easy to use.
2.	As a business owner, I want the website users to be able to find information about the band easily.
3.	As a business owner, I want the website to be a central hub for information and content with links to all social media and music streaming pages.
4.	As a business owner, I would like to expand our existing fan base.
5.	As a business owner, I would like for the users to have an option to enquire about booking the band for a gig or to gain more information.
6.	As a business owner, I would like to increase gig bookings and other opportunities.

## Structure

Mass Ctrlr website is designed to be effective, consistent and user friendly.
- Interaction Design
    - Consistent design will be used throughout the website to maintain a good UX.
    - The simple navigation bar with the band’s logo as the brand will make the website look simple and attractive.
    - The navigation links when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - The navigation link on the active page will provide a visual indication to the site visitors of what page they are currently viewing.
    - Buttons when hovered over will provide a visual indication to the site visitors what they are selecting.
    - Consistent color scheme will be used to let visitors focus on the band’s logo and brand. The ‘hero image’ on the main page will be chosen based on how it fits in with this color scheme also.
    - Links to external pages will open in a new tab so the user is not taken away from the band website.
- Information Architecture (IA)
    - The project was conceptualized to consist of a home page and three sub-pages. This structure was used because it is simple and familiar to the site visitors and it is sufficient for most user cases.
    - On each page there will be a consistent footer which will include:
        1. navigation links to external social media and music streaming pages.
        2.	Navigation link to the contact page, creating visual reminders to book the band or ask for more information
    - Each page is clearly titled to make navigating the site clear and simple.
    - The content is organized and categorized by importance from left to right (navigation).

## Skeleton

The initial webpage layouts were sketched on the paper. Upon agreement of the layout and hierarchy, the wireframes were created in Balsamiq. Please view the wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile screens on the following link: 

## Design

### Color Scheme

- I used three main colours for this project based on an existing logo the band use. The most eye catching colour being red. According to the Color Psychology shades of red are linked to passion and power which I believe are fitting for a rock band that are passionate about live music.
- The color # and # were used for text the darker shade being used for headings to make them stand out. The red color # was used sparingly to make key elements stand out, such as underlining headings, page dividers and links. Furthermore, the light background works well with the dark grey text and red highlights due to its contrast.
- To find an appealing off-white/red contrast, I happened upon the color combo on this [website](https://looka.com/blog/logo-color-combinations/) (Number 17 on the list) which fit in with the aesthetic I was looking to achieve.

### Fonts

- I used two fonts throughout the project, ** and **. Both were used with sans-serif font as a fallback. ** was used for the navigation and main headings and ** was used for the paragraph sections and footer.
- All headings are uppercase and have consistent letter spacing to make more of a visual impact.
- These fonts are used because of the excellent readability and appearance on screens of all sizes. These fonts were designed to be especially pleasant to read at very small sizes and both harmonize well with one another.
- Both fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Imagery

- For the website I used impactful images of the band to help create a visual story of the bands history and energy, including pictures from recording sessions and live performances. The main image used on the home page and contact form has similar colors to that of the website.
- The gallery page is split into different amount of columns of images depending on what device is being used so that this still looks visually appealing.
- All images were provided by the band and lead singer Jack Armstrong who have bought or have been gifted the images by the photographer. All permissions have been granted by the band for them to be used.
    - Credits to the photographers, where the information is available:

### Videos

All videos were provided by the band and lead singer Jack Armstrong who own the videos. All permissions have been granted by the band for them to be used. These have been taken from the bands Facebook page, using the embed code option, this also provides another avenue for site users to access this social media page and view other videos.

### Icons

I used several icons to improve the website's UX from - all came from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Features

Mass Ctrlr is built to be fully responsive mobile-first website. This was primarily achieved by utilizing the Bootstrap's grid system. The website consists of four pages: 'home' (landing), 'Music', 'Gallery’ and 'Get in touch' page. All website pages have a fixed navbar and footer.

### Current Features

- Navigation bar:
    - an easy way to navigate through the website to specific sections of the website.
    - it is fully responsive and it collapses to navbar-toggler-icon (hamburger menu) on medium and small devices.
- Footer bar – external links and easy link to ‘Get in touch’ page. 
    - The footer is consistent across all pages of the site and clearly allow the user to access the band’s music and social media pages which open in a new web page. 
    - o	The footer also reminds the user that they can get in touch with the band about bookings which is a link to the contact form of the page (opens in same window as not an external link).
- Responsive
    - Drop-down navbar on medium and small devices.
    - Size and layout differences to be more aesthetically pleasing on medium and small devices.
- Contact information
    - Contact form allows users to contact the band for more information and for bookings.

### Features for future Implemenatation

- Full functionality of the contact form page – at the moment the contact form does not go to the band as this has not been taught yet at this stage of my course. Ideally once the information has been submitted it would go to an email address associated with the band.
- An improved gig news section – due to the current lockdown in the UK, the band has no gigs planned so currently the music page just has text informing the users about this situation. Future feature, when the band can perform live again, would have a link to the ticket website and/or links to the gig venue (if they are different), an image of the gig poster etc. This section may warrant its own separate page in the future.
- Merchandise section – options for the user to buy the band’s merchandise, i.e adding payment methods to order products and collect the payment.
